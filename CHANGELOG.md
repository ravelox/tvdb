# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `POST /admin/database-import` endpoint to ingest database dumps with upsert semantics so environments can be restored from exports.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-22
### Added
- `GET /admin/database-dump` endpoint for exporting the full dataset, with matching tests, OpenAPI metadata, and Postman updates.

### Changed
- Bumped package, Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, and Postman versions to 1.6.0.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-21
### Added
- Optional `limit` and `offset` pagination parameters across all collection `GET` endpoints, with matching OpenAPI/README updates so clients can page large datasets predictably.

### Changed
- `/deployment-version` now bypasses API token enforcement so health checks and load balancers can read the running build metadata without credentials.
- Classic Doctor Who seed data now ships the full canonical episode list with proper titles, descriptions, and featured characters instead of placeholder entries.
- Bumped package, Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, and Postman versions to 1.5.0.

## [1.4.1] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- Explorer UI now uses cascading dropdowns for shows, seasons, episodes, and characters, providing clearer navigation and better keyboard accessibility.
- Refined explorer layout and styling so the selected show, episode, and character details stay focused while navigation happens in the dropdowns.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-07
### Added
- Explorer UI surfaces the running deployment version/build from `/deployment-version` so testers can confirm what they're using.
- GitHub Actions release automation now tags version bumps and publishes GitHub releases automatically.
- `seed_sapphire_and_steel.sh` seeds ITV's Sapphire & Steel catalog with cast, seasons, episodes, and episode-to-actor links.

### Changed
- Database initialization, resets, and pooled queries retry fatal MySQL errors using the new `DB_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`/`DB_RETRY_DELAY_MS` environment controls.
- All seed scripts share a resilient helper that sources `$API_TOKEN` from `.env`, retries API calls, and preserves actor assignments when reseeding characters.
- Docker build helper logs the final `<version>.<build>` tag after each run for easier release tracing.

### Fixed
- Linking characters to episodes no longer clears existing actor associations when the actor isn't being updated.
- Explorer endpoints consistently return actor metadata for characters so the UI displays cast information reliably.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-30
### Added
- Standalone TV Explorer web app served at `/explorer`, featuring API token authentication, cascading show/season/episode navigation, and per-episode character displays.
- `seed_sapphire_and_steel.sh` seeding script to populate the Sapphire & Steel catalog through the public API helpers.

### Changed
- Hardened database calls by retrying fatal connection errors, refreshing the MySQL pool on demand, and exposing the explorer bundle from the main Express app.
- Helm deployment now annotates pods with checksums of the app and storage secrets so upgrades roll when credentials change.
- Docker build helper accepts repository overrides and prunes older build tags after a successful push to keep registries tidy.

### Fixed
- Explorer authentication modal surfaces validation feedback, persists tokens defensively, and reliably closes after a successful connection.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-23
### Added
- POST `/admin/reset-database` endpoint to drop and reinitialize the schema via the API.
- API smoke test coverage for the admin reset workflow.

### Changed
- `reset_database.sh` now calls the admin API instead of executing SQL locally.
- README, OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes defaults bumped to 1.2.0.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-22
### Changed
